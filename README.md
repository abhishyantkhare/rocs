Radically Open Content System

Content delivery is broken in many ways. We are siloed into websites where users post content and reliant on what users post and the rules of that website. In addition, to get better results we have to sell our data to tech companies to get targeted with better ads. ROCS attempts to provide a third path. Own your data, and provide an infrastructure where users can utilize the vast amount of cheap computing power we have and ML advances to see content from all across the internet they want. In short, put the internet to work for you.
